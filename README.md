# rsa_python
RSA Encryption implementation in python

This library was created for me to practice making well documented and tested code. However, this is still meant to be a fully functional library and will be available on pip.


##Usage:

As this is asymmetric encryption, both ends of communication should use this library. The goes is eventually to have this compatible with openSSL and openSSH but we'll see how far this goes.

##Todo:
* create public and private key classes.
* encrypt numbers
* encrypt files
* send signatures

##Docs:
theres no host for the docs, but you can build them yourself.
